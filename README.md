  * The three discrepancies from Masked Language Modeling (MLM) pretraining, Script, Language, and Labels, lead into a naive specialization as such can be suboptimal. Script and linguistic discrepancy of the target language from the related seen languages, hinder a positive transfer, for which authors propose to maximize representation similarity, unlike existing approaches maximizing overlaps.

  * The proposed relevance-guided generation, is divided in two simple subtasks, generating relevance explanations and guiding the generation to avoid negative generalization. Relevance-guided generation method is more robust to domain shifts when key biases cause sampled Psuedo Queries (PQ) to be irrelevant, negatively contributing to generalization. 

* Chaining Event Spans for Temporal Relation Grounding (EACL 2024) - Jongho Kim, Dohyeon Lee, Minsoo Kim, and Seung-won Hwang.
